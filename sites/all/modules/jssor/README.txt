## Installation

First you create new folder either in the sites/all/modules folder or just
directly in the modules folder at the drupal root.
The good news is that you can move the folder event after it's already enable.
No more need to rebuild the registry. You can thanks the clever autoloading
capability of Drupal 8.

## Requirements

Download the jssor slider, rename the folder as 'jssor-slider' and place it
under your libraries folder. So you structure should look like this:
libraries/jssor-slider/js/jssor.slider.min.js
